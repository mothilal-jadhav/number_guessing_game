# Number Guessing Game

HI i am creating a very easy Number Guessing Game

## Backstory

i am not new to python but i am starting everything from scratch this time, so in this Journey i am starting from building very basic projects that will brush up my python knowledge. 

## Objective

so the objective project is building a game of guessing a number. the user will guess a number and if it is wrong then the output will be based on the difference between the answer and his guessed answer

like if the answer is 23 and the guessed number is 50 then the output will be too high and then the the user will be given a chance again where to guess and this time by his intution if the user guesses say 18 then it says so close to the answer and this iterates till the user guesses the number and the no. of guesses will be the final output.
